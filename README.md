# Tutor's Adda

On this global platform, multiple teachers can launch their
online courses on any subject, and students can select the
courses based on their preferences and reviews of teachers. This
platform will help teachers to manage their individual schedules
and assist them in managing quizzes. At the end of each course,
students can give reviews to the teacher regarding their
performance to help other students while selecting courses.
